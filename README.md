# PGM-implementation

Implementation of Neuron Model through Danya Abbot's book 

uses nodes to represent neuronse

and further uses that to predict for tasks

Does this by testing on certain jobs

pgmpy creates this network as a Directed Acyclic Graph which is further used to infer various properties of the network

for eg

Independencies
